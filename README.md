# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



üìù My Approach to the Pokemon Explorer App
1. Making the List Better
Pagination: I added buttons so you can see 10, 20, or 50 Pok√©mon at a time, and you can go to the next or previous page to see more.

Sorting: I made it so you can sort Pok√©mon by their ID, name, or alphabetically, just by clicking a button!

Filter by Type: I let you choose more than one Pok√©mon type at the same time (like Fire, Water, Grass), so it‚Äôs easier to find the Pokemon you like.

2. Pokemon Details
I made a special page for each Pok√©mon. You can see their stats, moves, abilities, and even how they evolve!

You can click on a Pok√©mon from the list, and it‚Äôll take you to that Pok√©mon's page.

3. Favorites
I let you "star" or "favorite" Pok√©mon that you like. You can see all your favorites in a special section.

If you refresh the page, your favorites stay saved, thanks to something called localStorage. It‚Äôs like a magic box that remembers things!

4. Cool Extra Features
Compare Pok√©mon: I added a feature where you can compare two Pok√©mon to see which one is stronger, faster, and has more health.

Random Pok√©mon: There's a button that picks a random Pok√©mon and shows you its details!

Error Handling: If something goes wrong, like if a Pokemon doesn‚Äôt load, I made sure the app doesn‚Äôt crash. It just shows an error message instead.

5. How I Built It
I used React (a way to build websites) and React Context API (it helps save data like your favorites).

I made sure the app runs fast by using things called useMemo and useCallback, which are like tools to help your app not get too slow when it‚Äôs doing a lot of work.

I organized everything into neat folders so it‚Äôs easy to find things.

Challenges I Faced
Getting Info from the Internet: I needed to get a lot of info about each Pokemon from the internet, which took time and could break if something went wrong. I fixed it by asking for info in a smart way so I wouldn‚Äôt ask too many times.

Keeping Track of Everything: There was a lot of stuff to keep track of like sorting, filtering, and favorites. I used a system called React Context to make it easier.

Making it Work on All Devices: I wanted the app to look good on phones, tablets, and computers. It was tricky, but I used something called responsive design to make sure everything fits on any screen.

Fixing Errors: If something goes wrong, I didn‚Äôt want the app to break, so I added a special system to catch errors and show nice messages.
